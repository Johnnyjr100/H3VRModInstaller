This is a program which installs mods for H3VR for you. The system that is used allows us to update mods automatically for H3VRMI without needing a new release. That being said, H3VRMI is currently NOT finished and is subject to updates/issues.

## How To install H3VR Mod Installer

## Usage in other games

While H3VRMI was specifically designed for H3VR, it was also designed with the idea that it could be used for other games. If you want to make H3VRMI work for a game, take a [look at our wiki page on it.](https://github.com/Frityet/H3VRModInstaller/wiki/Utilizing-ModInstaller-for-Other-Games-(MICOverride))

## Known Issues

- Mods will firstly display as conflicting before displayed as disabled, meaning mods will still display red if they are disabled but would conflict with another mod. This is purely a UI issue.

- Mod Installer will NOT work if it is located in the main H3 directory. This is because BepInEx interferes with Mod Installer.
